071516_BSA_BDP_SteppedNCE_Top5_27_42.hk1      MS1 scans deconvoluted using the tool Hardklor
071516_BSA_BDP_SteppedNCE_Top5_27_42.hk2      MS2 scans deconvoluted using the tool Hardklor


Hardklor identifies peaks based on their isotope pattern and reports their "deconvoluted" neutral mass instead of the m/z value.
To run Hardklor, edit Hardklor.conf then run "./hardklor Hardklor.conf"

mango.cpp                                    Initial attempt at writing program to identify cross-linked peptide
                                              pairs from this data.

Steps:
1.  Need accurate precursor mass.  This is the mass of the intact cross-link species.
Will grab measured precursor from mzXML file.  Then use Harklor .hk1 file to hopefully
find a more accurate precursor mass because the one reported in the raw data can be
more accurate.
2.  Next, read .hk2 file to get accurate, deconvoluted masses in the MS/MS spectrum.
We need to find a pairs of masses that added up to the precursor mass (including
addition of the 751 reporter).
3.  Now that we have a list of pairs of peptide masses, we must grab all peptides from
the database that contain these masses.  Generate all combinations of peptide pairs,
fragment both peptides, and score results.  Must figure out scoring algorithm including
how to tell if a score is significant or not.




Cross-linker information:

scan 24686, 4+ precursor, mass 3341.62103
ALKAWSVAR (1000.5818) + CASIQKFGER (1195.581544)

Others, mystery scans right now:

ALKAWSVAR (1000.5818)  + DTHKSEIAHR (1192.594884)
LSQKFPK   (846.496339) + ALKAWSVAR  (1000.5818)
SLGKVGTR (816.481752)  + CASIQKFGER (1195.581544)
LSQKFPK   (846.496339) + CASIQKFGER (1195.581544)

This cross-linker adds a mass of 197.032422 to the internal K residue.
